Analysis of a temporal dataset detailing the microbiome of filed-grown rice plants that were grown in multiple locations over multiple growing seasons.

Study Information:

Description:
Due to their potential uses in sustainable agriculture it is important that we develop a robust understanding of microbe community composition and formation patterns in agriculturally relevant plants. Rice, a staple food crop for over half the global population presents a key model for such studies. This project will analyse a publicly available dataset that tracks the microbiome composition in field-grown rice plants over three growing seasons in two geographically distinct locations. The dataset includes detailed temporal sampling from three plant-associated compartments that make up the microbiome: the endosphere, rhizoplane, and rhizosphere. The study aim is to investigate patterns of microbiome assembly in this important crop, to identify key microbial taxa and any trends in community formation. Insights from this analysis could lead to improved rice cultivation by effectively harnessing relevant PGP microbes.

Hypotheses:
1.	The microbiome composition will change over the lifespan of the rice plant, and a similar compositional shift will occur in each growing season. This shift will not be a sweeping directional change, but rather an altered abundance of key taxa that have different levels of association with rice plants across different life-stages.
2.	Microbiome composition will vary between sites, but certain microbes that makeup a 'core microbiome' will be present in both.
