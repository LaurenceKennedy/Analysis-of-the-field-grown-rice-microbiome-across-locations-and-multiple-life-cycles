Study Information:
This project analyses a publicly available dataset that tracks the microbiome composition in field-grown rice plants over three growing seasons in two geographically distinct locations. 
The dataset includes detailed temporal sampling from three plant-associated compartments that make up the microbiome: the endosphere, rhizoplane, and rhizosphere. 
The study aim is to investigate patterns of microbiome assembly in this important crop, to identify key microbial taxa and any trends in community formation.
